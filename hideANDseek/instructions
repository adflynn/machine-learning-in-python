Emma has n friends
grid size NxN
each friend is in some coordinate so that no one can see them
each friend can only see in 8 directions (NSEW, D1234), straight lines
cannot see through trees
find initial positions for friends

CSP:
variables are grid locations {A11, A12, etc}
domain for each is states {friend, tree, empty}
describe constraints on each variable
implement backtracking search to find assignment

input:
first line= N (friends) K (trees)
next K lines= (x,y) coords of trees

output:
any order
